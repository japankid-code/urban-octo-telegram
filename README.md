# Code Refactor Starter Code

this code was forked and refactored to meet accessibility requirements.

A given webpage meets accessibility standards when:
+ HTML contains elements which are semantic throughout the document.
+ The HTML elements follow a logical structure *independent* of styling and positioning.
+ Image elements contain accessible alt attributes.
+ The heading attributes fall in sequential order.
+ Title element displays a concise, descriptive title.
